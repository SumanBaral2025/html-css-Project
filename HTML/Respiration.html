    <p> In physiology, <i>respiration is the transport of oxygen from the outside environment to the cells within tissues,
        and the removal of carbon dioxide in the opposite direction to the environment by a respiratory system.</i>
    </p><br>
    <p>The physiological definition of respiration differs from the biochemical definition, which refers to a metabolic
        process by which an organism obtains energy (in the form of ATP and NADPH) by oxidizing nutrients and
        releasing waste products. Although physiological respiration is necessary to sustain cellular respiration and
        thus
        life in animals, the processes are distinct: cellular respiration takes place in individual cells of the
        organism, while physiological respiration concerns the diffusion and transport of metabolites between the
        organism
        and the external environment. </p>

    <p align="left">There are two types of Respiration:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Aerobic Respiration:</b> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> →
            6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + energy (as ATP).</li>

        <li><b>Anaerobic Respiration:</b> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> →
            2C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + energy.</li>
